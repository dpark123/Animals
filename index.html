    <p>The tiger is a majestic beast cat. It is very fierce with its sharp clows and teeth.
        Nobody messes with the tiger, except maybe the honey badger.</p>
    <p>His main characterist that everyone knows are the stripes. With his bright orange fur and the dark black stripes, this cat is one that everyone adores and respects.</p>
